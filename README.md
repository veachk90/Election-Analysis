# Election-Analysis

### Overview
The goal of this project was to determine the results of an election, both the winning candidate and the county that produced the most votes. The raw data came from the polls in a CSV file. My task, then, was to count the votes and compile a report with the necessary information. 

### Methodology
The first decision to make was which tool to use. The file provide was an Excel CSV file, so VBA would have been a good choice. Were I the individual responsible for presenting the results, I may have elected to use VBA for its practical interface with Excel and ability to quickly produce graphs. In this case, though, my manager, Tom, only required a written report in a text file that he could easily access from Command Prompt. Thus, I decided that Python would be the tool to use for its ease of loading, creating, and writing to files. Python was also useful for its ability to use formatted print lines, which proved very practical in this project.
